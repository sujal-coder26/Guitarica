        The key of a song is a quick way to figure out what chords and notes
        the song is built around. The notes and chords utilized in a song in
        the key of C will be based on the C Major Scale. The notes and
        chords of a song in the key of D would be based on the D Major
        Scale.This can be confusing at first. If a song is in the key of C,
        it means there are no sharp or flat notes (take a look at the C
        Major Scale to learn more). But just because the song is in the key
        of C, it doesnâ€™t mean it must stick to those notes. The song can
        easily make use of notes and chords outside of the key. At first,
        this might be perplexing. When a song is written in the key of C,
        there are no sharp or flat notes (take a look at the C Major Scale
        to learn more). However, just because the music is in the key of C
        doesn't imply it has to stay in that key. Outside of the key, the
        song may easily employ notes and chords.

        So, There are two ways of finding the keys of the song.
        <b>First is by looking at the tabs.</b> Not all songs has tabs. So
        this is only used when you see the tab chart. In the chart there is
        a indicator for # and b. So, just by seeing the number of sharp,
        flats from the chart we can identify the key of the song. If there
        is only one # symbol in the tab chart then we can say that the key
        of the song is G major/E minor. If it has 1 flat symbol then the
        song is in the key of F. You will understand more by looking at the
        image above

        <b>The 2nd way is by looking at the chords used.</b>
        See the chart above. The 1st column shows the Keys as major scales.
        'C' means the 'key of C' or 'C Major Scale'. Each rows refers to the
        note used in that scale and the bottom row shows the type.
        <br />
        Suppose, A song has these following chords: G Major, A minor, B
        minor, Eminor, F# diminished. So, by comparing from the chart we
        conclude that the song is in the key of 'G' as all the chords of G
        scale are used in the song.The best technique to figure out what key
        a song is in is to look at all of the chords and match them to all
        of the potential keys.
