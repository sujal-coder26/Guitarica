        The circle of fifths is a chart that shows you how to get around the
        twelve musical keys. The circle of fifths may appear to be a boring
        music theory lesson, yet it is one of the most important ideas to
        understand in music. It will assist you in remembering key
        signatures, locating yourself on your instrument, and releasing your
        creativity via chords and progressions. With such a practical
        notion, it helps to have some previous knowledge. But that doesn't
        imply it has to be tough or perplexing. In truth, all you really
        need to know about the circle of fifths is the fundamentals. I'll
        explain what it is, how it works, and how it can help you compose
        music in this post.

        <br />
        The circle of fifths is a method of visualizing and organizing the
        twelve musical keys. It's used in music to assist people recall the
        notes that make up each key and to group keys together based on the
        notes they have in common. The order of sharps and flats for
        creating musical scores is determined by following the stages of the
        circle in order. The circle of fifths gets its name from the fact
        that each key on the circle is separated by a fifth interval.

            Circle of fifths tells us the number of sharp and flat notes in a
            scale. If you go clockwise, then the clock number gives you the
            total number of sharps. You can see above and find that no # is in
            C and G has 2#. Same goes for flat but you need to move
            anticlockwise. See above for more clarification.
        </li>
        <li>
            We can know the number of sharps and flats & also we can know what
            are those sharp and flat notes.For #, Just move clockwise from 11o'clock
            i.e from 'F'. Let's see for D, when you move from 11 you will find
            F and C. Hence the 2 sharp notes are F# and C#.

        <li>
            To know the flat note just move anticlockwise from the 5 o'Ã§lock.
            Let's see the clock for Bb. Looking above we can see that there
            are 2 flats. So, let's move from the 5o'clock, i.e Bb and Eb.

            We can also find the chords inside the scale. Lets find the relative chords of scale C. The theory says: the
            note before and after C will be major. And after the after note,
            the 3 notes will be minor and then the last one will be
            diminished. i.e C has: F major, G major, D minor, E minor, A minor
            and B diminished.

            Determine how far around the circle you need to traverse to go
            from the original key to the new key using the Circle of Fifths.
            It's simply one note from C to G in this situation. Move the
            preset amount of notes around the circle starting from the initial
            key's note. As an example, an
            A in C would be transposed to an E in G.
